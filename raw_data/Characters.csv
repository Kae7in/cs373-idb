Harry Potter	Harry Potter is?The Boy Who Lived, one of the most famous wizards of his time. In July 1980, Voldemort tried to murder Harry Potter while he was still a baby, afraid of a prophecy that said Potter would be the one to defeat him. His mother Lily Potter sacrificed herself for Harry, which gave Harry an ancient form of protection magic based on love. This protection caused Voldemort's killing curse to backfire onto himself, but left Harry with a lightning-shaped cursed scar on his forehead. This created a connection between Harry and Voldemort, allowing Harry to speak Parseltongue.
