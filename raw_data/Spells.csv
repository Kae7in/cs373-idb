Patronus Charm;Expecto Patronum;"Conjures a silver guardian spirit made of pure positive energy used to repel dark creatures such as Dementors and Lethifolds and can be either corporeal or not. In a weaker form, a Patronus takes the form of smoke or vapor which can halt dark creatures but is not nearly strong enough to repel them. In its stronger form, a Patronus takes the form of some creature (corporeal form) that relates to the casters' personality and is by far more powerful than the non-corporeal form and able to repel dark creatures in large groups.

This is a very powerful spell that even many qualified witches and wizards cannot conjure. It requires the caster focus on the happiest memory that they can think of which often translates into the strength of the spell itself. Dark wizards and witches are typically unable to cast this spell either due to their already existing affinity for dark creatures and that there is a chance that the spell may backfire on them. Harry Potter was able to learn this from Remus Lupin during his third year to repel dementors.
