Deathly Hallows;"The Deathly Hallows are three powerful magical objects created by Death given to three brothers, Antioch Peverell, Cadmus Peverell, and Ignotus Peverell. Many years ago, the Peverell brothers were travelling at twilight and reached an uncrossable river. Since they were wizards, they simply created a bridge to cross. Death stopped them, congragulating them on escaping him, and offered each an object of their choosing. Antioch received the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand of all time. Cadmus received the Resurrection Stone, a stone which could bring the dead back to life. Finally, Ignotus received the Cloak of Invisibility, as he did not trust Death and wanted to continue escaping him.

After each went their separate ways, Antioch bragged about the power of the Elder Wand and was murdered in his sleep by another who wanted to possess it. Cadmus used the Resurrection Stone to bring back his dead lover, but what came back was not truly her. He committed suicide from grief. Ignotus used the cloak and finally greeted Death willingly as an old man.

According to this legend, the person who holds all three of these items becomes the Master of Death. Only Harry Potter has had all three at once. Harry received the Invisibility Cloak from his father, James Potter, and it is believed that Ignotus Peverell is a paternal ancestor to him. Albus Dumbledore had the Elder Wand, but lost it to Draco Malfoy who disarmed him. Harry Potter eventually took this from Malfoy. Finally, Dumbledore left the Resurrection Stone to Harry in the golden snitch left to him in Dumbledore's will.";legend;13th century;"Antioch Peverell

The Boy Who Lived;"Harry Potter was born on July 31st, 1980, to Lily and James Potter. His parents were members of the Order of the Phoenix, an organization dedicated to bringing about the ruin of Lord Voldemort. From birth, he lived in hiding with his parents after Voldemort marked him, and Neville Longbottom, for death. Neville was born just a few hours before Harry Potter. Voldemort feared the boys because of The Prophecy.

His parents were going to make Sirius Black their Secret-Keeper, the only security loophole through the Fidelius Charm keeping them hidden in Godric's Hollow. However, they changed their secret keeper to Peter Pettigrew instead, whom they thought would be less suspicious. Unfortunately, Pettigrew was already a spy for Voldemort and he betrayed the Potters, faked his death, and framed Sirius for both as no one else knew who the true Secret-Keeper was.

Halloween 1981, Voldemort came to Godric's Hollow to murder the Potter family. He killed James immediately, and then killed Lily, who died protecting her son Harry. This sacrifice gave Harry an ancient magical protection based on love, and Voldemort's killing curse backfired on him. Voldemort lost all his powers, his physical form was destroyed, and Harry was left with a cursed lightning-shaped scar which formed a connection between him and his parents' killer. Everyone believed Voldemort was dead, but he would slowly crawl back from the unknown thanks to his maniacal use of horcruxes.

Thus ended the reign of terror of Lord Voldemort, leaving Harry Potter as an orphan and the only person to have ever survived the killing curse. At just one year of age, Harry Potter became one of the most famous wizards to ever live. ";history;October 31st, 1980;"Lord Voldemort

International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy;"The International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy is a law in the wizarding rule first signed in 1689, then officially established in 1692. This law protects the wizarding community from Muggles, hiding their existence from their world.

In the 17th century, wizard-Muggle relations were at their worst. Ever since the 15th century, witches and wizards were being persecuted all over Europe. They were locked up and sentenced to death on the charge of witchcraft. While some managed to escape like Wendelin the Weird, others like Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington were not so lucky. Children were especially vulnerable, as they were unable to control their own magic, making them noticeable and powerless against their attackers. Muggles were also mistakenly identified as magical, and they had no magic to protect them from being burned at the stake.

The Ministry of Magic, recently created, attempted to deal with the muggle British Monarch, begging for protection under muggle law. This did not happen, which seems to be the final straw that forced the wizarding world into secrecy.

The Statute states that each Ministry of Magic administration is responsible for hiding the presence of the magical community within their own countries. Among other things, they must control magical beasts, public displays of underage magic, and ensure that magical games and sports are played without risk of discovery. Wizards and witches are required to blend in with the muggle community when about, such as wearing appropriate dress code around muggles.";law;1692;"Wendelin the Weird

The Chamber of Secrets;"In the Middle Ages, when Hogwarts was first formed, Salazar Slytherin had a dispute with the other founders about whom to admit into the school. Slytherin wanted only pure-blood students, but the others did not share his prejudice. Slytherin left the school, but not before creating the Chamber of Secrets somewhere under the dungeon of Hogwarts.

The Chamber of Secrets was home to an ancient basilisk, which was intended to purge the school of Muggle-born students. Only Slytherin's heir could gain entrance by using Parseltongue, an ability only heirs of Slytherin possessed. For centuries headmasters tried to find the Chamber, to no avail. Many dismissed the Chamber as a mere legend.

Twice it has been opened, by Tom Marvolo Riddle in 1943 and by Ginny Weasley, possessed by Riddle's horcrux diary, in 1992. The first time, Riddle's last victim, Moaning Myrtle, was killed. Riddle placed the blame on Rubeus Hagrid, whom he caught nursing a pet acromantula named Aragog. Everyone assumed this to be the monster that was terrorizing the school. Hagrid was expelled and Riddle received a trophy of Special Services to the School. However, Albus Dumbledore, then a Transfiguration professor, distrusted Riddle from here on out and kept a close eye on him.

Since the case seemed to be closed, it was no longer safe for Riddle to open the Chamber. He created a diary, preserving his sixteen-year-old self, hoping one day to lead someone else into the Chamber of Secrets to continue his work. This happened when Ginny Weasley found the diary, planted in her belongings by Lucius Malfoy.

Luckily, no one died this time around. Ginny Weasley was close to death, fading away in the Chamber of Secrets, when Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger came to her rescue. Harry Potter, who can use Parseltongue thanks to the connection he has with Voldemort through his cursed scar, defeated the Basilisk with Godric Gryffindor's sword, and destroyed Tom Riddle's diary.";legend;;"Salazar Slytherin

The Triwizard Tournament;"The Triwizard Tournament is a magical contest held between the three largest wizarding schools of Europe: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Durmstrang Institute, and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, each school being represented by one Champion. Selected Champions compete in three tasks - traditionally judged by the Headmasters or Headmistresses of the competing schools - designed to test magical ability, intelligence and courage. Champions compete for the honour and glory of winning the Tournament and for the Triwizard Cup and a monetary prize. The first Tournament was held in 1294. The Tournament has been renowned for being extremely dangerous: champions have died while competing, and so it was discontinued after 1792.

The Triwizard Tournament was established as a friendly competition between the wizarding schools the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, and the Durmstrang Institute. Held every five years, the competition would be hosted by each school in turn, the judges for the Tournament comprising the headmasters or headmistresses of the schools. Each competing school is allowed one Champion to represent them during the Tournament. Students wishing to participate write their names and the school they attend on a piece of parchment, and enter it into the Goblet of Fire. The Goblet is an impartial judge, and selects what it considers to be the best student from each school. At the appointed time, the Goblet ejects the names, making each selected student the official Champion for their school. Each selected Champion is then bound by a magical contract to see the Tournament through to the end. The Yule Ball, held on Christmas Day night, is a traditional part of the Tournament. The Ball usually includes a feast, and a formal dance where the Champions and their partners lead the host school in dancing. Students old enough to attend are allowed to bring a friend. Students that are too young to attend may attend if invited by a student old enough to attend the ball.

A revival of the Tournament occurred in 1994. Barty Crouch Sr., Head of the Ministry of Magic's Department of International Magical Cooperation, in conjunction with Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, worked with their opposite numbers in other countries to revive the Tournament. However, due to the dangerous nature of the Tournament, it was decided that some changes were to be made to the rules, with the main one being that no student under the age of seventeen was allowed to enter or compete (some students did try to).

Despite the secrecy surrounding the Triwizard Tournament, Lord Voldemort found out about it from Bertha Jorkins, a Ministry employee in the Department of Magical Games and Sports who had been holidaying in Albania and had run into Peter Pettigrew at an inn. Armed with this information, Voldemort set a plan into motion. He freed Crouch Jr from the Imperius Curse, and ordered him to disguise himself as Alastor Moody, Hogwarts' new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. There, he would manipulate the Tournament as his Master commanded to achieve the Dark Lord's goal: the destruction of Harry Potter. 

During the third task, Harry Potter and Cedric Diggory, the Hogwarts champion chosen fairly by the Goblet of Fire, were transported via portkey to a graveyard in Little Hangleton to meet Voldemort. Voldemort only intended Harry Potter to make it there, so Cedric Diggory was swiftly killed. Harry managed to escape, but Voldemort was reborn.";sport;1294;"Harry Potter

The Prophecy;"Sybill Trelawney spoke a prophecy to Albus Dumbledore at the Hog's Head Pub in 1980. The prophecy was made during an interview for the spot of Diviniation professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Dumbledore, who was disappointed at the performance she gave during the interview, was about to leave when she went into a trance and made the prophecy. It referred to a boy born at the end of July, who has the power to defeat Lord Voldemort. Severus Snape was eavesdropping on their conversation is who relayed the prophecy to Voldemort. Voldemort chose to go after Harry Potter as he was half-blood, but Neville Longbottom, a pure-blood, also fit the criteria of the prophecy.

Shocked by Voldemort's decision, Snape hastened to Dumbledore and explained that Voldemort had come to the conclusion that the Potters' child was his would-be vanquisher, and had vowed to kill him. Snape also confessed his longtime love for Harry's mother, Lily, and offered Dumbledore his loyalty in exchange for her protection. Snape was now loyal to two masters, who were enemies.";history;1980;"Sybill Trelawney

Quidditch;"Quidditch is a wizarding sport played on broomsticks. It is the most popular game among wizards and witches. The object of the game is to score more points than your opponents. Each goal is worth ten points and catching the Snitch is worth one-hundred fifty points. The game ends when the Snitch is caught or an agreement is reached between the captains of both teams. Some games can go on for many days if the Snitch is not caught (the record, according to Quidditch Through the Ages, is three months).

The game is played by two teams of seven people (three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper, and one Seeker) and involves four balls (a Quaffle, two Bludgers, and a Golden Snitch).

The Keeper guards the goal posts, while the three Chasers score goals with the Quaffle by tossing it into one of the opposing team's three goal posts. The two Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team and hit the Bludgers towards the opposing team, and the Seeker catches the Golden Snitch to end the game. The team whose Seeker catches the Snitch is awarded 150 points, but this does not necessarily mean they will win if the other team still has more points after the Snitch is caught.";sport;1050;"Harry Potter

Order of the Phoenix;"The Order of the Phoenix was a secret society founded by Albus Dumbledore to oppose Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. The original Order was created sometime in 1970s, after Voldemort returned to England from abroad and started his campaign to take over the Ministry of Magic and persecute Muggle-borns. The Order worked with the Ministry to oppose the Dark Lord and his followers, and played a crucial role in the First Wizarding War. Victory came in 1981 at the cost of many of their members

The Order disbanded, but was reconvened in 1995 after Harry Potter informed Dumbledore of Lord Voldemort's return. The Ministry refused to admit that the Dark Lord had returned, thus the Order alone worked to protect Harry Potter and the prophecy concerning him and Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries. After a battle occurred there in 1996 between the Order and the Death Eaters, the Ministry admitted the truth. However, the next year would see the Order losing their leader and the Ministry being conquered by Voldemort. The Order remained an underground resistance, trying to protect Muggles and broadcast the truth during the worst days of the Second Wizarding War. They answered the call to arms by Dumbledore's Army on 2 May, 1998, fighting Voldemort and his Death Eaters for the final time at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The Battle of Hogwarts ended with Voldemort's death and a decisive victory for the Order and their allies.";organization;1970;"Albus Dumbledore

Campaign to Discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter;"This campaign encapsulates the Ministry of Magic's attempts to discredit, slander, and smear both Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter, as well as anyone perceived or believed to be an ally with them. It was put in place on June 24th, 1995 — after the Rebirth of Lord Voldemort and ended on June 18th, 1996 — after the Battle of the Department of Mysteries. This campaign was put into place when Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge denied the Dark Lord's return, a fact that would ruin the thirteen years of peace that the Ministry had worked so hard to build and maintain. Instead, due to paranoia, he believed that Dumbledore was trying to usurp his position of Minister for Magic, and not only used the Daily Prophet to make it look as though Dumbledore and Potter were liars and ""nutters,"" but also stripped Dumbledore of many of his titles and statuses: Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, the Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot, the Order of Merlin, and eventually the Headmastership of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Harry, for supporting Dumbledore and being the one who claimed Voldemort returned, also suffered from this campaign. Fudge planted Dolores Umbridge as the Hogwarts High Inquisitor and headmistress in order to further destabilise Dumbledore and Harry. Fudge also made it clear that anyone siding with Dumbledore should clear out their desks in the Ministry's office. Due to the great influence the Ministry had, the majority of the wizarding community ceased supporting Dumbledore and Harry and lost a chance to prepare themselves against Voldemort. The campaign also pressed the position that Harry was a deluded attention-seeker that could not be trusted.

When Voldemort was revealed to have truly returned, Fudge was forced to accept it and to reveal everything to the world, by which time it was too late to prepare. The campaign, along with all the Educational Decrees and Daily Prophet articles that were crafted to fuel it, were all retracted, and Fudge was subsequently dismissed in disgrace.";history;1995;"Harry Potter

Dumbledore's Army;"Dumbledore's Army, also known as the D.A. or Defence Association, was a secret organisation initiated by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley to teach their fellow Hogwarts students proper Defence Against the Dark Arts in 1995. This organisation was made necessary by the refusal of Dolores Umbridge, the subject's professor during the 1995-1996 school year, to teach anything in her classes other than textbook theory. It had approximately 28 members. The group was disbanded during the 1996-1997 school year following the appointment of Severus Snape as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, although several members heeded the call and participated in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower at the end of the year.

It was restarted by Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood during the 1997-1998 school year after Hogwarts fell under the control of Lord Voldemort in order to oppose Death Eater professors Alecto and Amycus Carrow, who spread propaganda against Muggles and Muggle-borns and taught the Dark Arts. Dumbledore's Army played a vital role during the Second Wizarding War, and members of the organisation fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and the Battle of Hogwarts.";organization;1995;"Harry Potter
