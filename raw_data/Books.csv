The Tales of Beedle The Bard,"The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a collection of stories written for young wizards and witches, published by Chelf Press. They were popular bedtime stories for centuries, with the result that The Wizard and the Hopping Pot and The Fountain of Fair Fortune were as familiar to many of the students at Hogwarts as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are to various Muggle children.",Beedle the Bard,The Tale of the Three Brothers,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tales_of_Beedle_the_Bard
Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean,"In 1994, Barty Crouch Jr., disguised as Alastor Moody, gave a copy of this book to Neville Longbottom. As part of Crouch Jr.'s plan to manipulate the Triwizard Tournament to allow Harry Potter to win, he placed the book within Harry's reach as it contained information on Gillyweed, which would allow him to pass the Second Task. However, due to Harry's pride (not asking for help from everyone around him), he did not discover this book.",Hadrian Whittle,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_Water_Plants_of_the_Mediterranean
Flesh-Eating Trees of the World,"Flesh-Eating Trees of the World was a book used by Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as a sixth year Herbology text. Among other subjects, it covered the correct way to juice a Snargaluff pod and self-fertilising shrubs.",Unknown,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Flesh-Eating_Trees_of_the_World
A History of Magic,"A History of Magic was a book written by Bathilda Bagshot, one of the most eminent magical historians, covering the history of the wizarding world up to the end of the 19th century. It was first published in 1947 by Little Red Books. A second edition was released by M. L. Books at an unknown date.

It was a required text for all Hogwarts students from the first year onward for the History of Magic class taught by Professor Binns. Hermione Granger had an extra copy of this book in her school trunk. A copy of this book costs 2 Galleons at Flourish and Blotts.",Bathilda Bagshot,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/A_History_of_Magic
Magical Me,"Magical Me is the autobiography of Gilderoy Lockhart, part of his collected works. It includes much of his (later proven false) achievements.",Gilderoy Lockhart,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Magical_Me
The Toadstool Tales,"The Toadstool Tales were a series of adaptations of other works, written by Beatrix Bloxam. They contained soppy, ""sanitized"" versions of other works, including the The Tales of Beedle the Bard , which was Mrs. Bloxam's way of purifying them so as to preserve childrens' innocence. Beatrix Bloxam set out to write The Toadstool Tales because of the ""unwholesome characters"" and themes found in The Tales of Beedle the Bard that she believed were damaging to children.",Beatrix Bloxam,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Toadstool_Tales
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore,"The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore is a biography of Albus Dumbledore that was written by Rita Skeeter. Though it ran nine-hundred pages in length, Skeeter completed the book only four weeks after Dumbledore's death in June 1997, meaning that it was probably published in July of that year. As was her common tendency, Rita swooped down in the immediate wake of a death to ensure that public interest remained high, whilst fully exploiting the legal situation that the dead cannot be libelled. The book was rated with five stars by the Daily Prophet. Prior to its release, Betty Braithwaite had visited Rita's home for an interview about the title, and Rita served her tea and a slice of pound cake. It is probably because of this ""warmth and softness"" that Braithwaite's write-up was highly favourable and quite heavily biased in favour of Skeeter.",Rita Skeeter,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Life_and_Lies_of_Albus_Dumbledore
"Hogwarts, A History","Hogwarts: A History, also known as Hogwarts, A History, is a book concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its history that was written by Bathilda Bagshot. It was Hermione Granger's favourite book and she often referred to this book on many things concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Three of the things that are frequently brought up are the Great Hall's enchanted ceiling that shows the weather outside, the fact that you cannot apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds and the fact that electronic devices do not work within the grounds.

The book was also very popular in Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, when every copy was checked out of the library due to the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets. This caused Hermione great frustration, as despite her fondness for the book, she had left it behind that year due to lack of space because of the many texts assigned by Gilderoy Lockhart. However, Hermione shows slight frustration with the book when scathingly renaming the book in her fourth year because it does not mention the use of house-elves at Hogwarts, even going so far as to suggest a couple of alternative titles for it: A Revised History of Hogwarts and A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.

In 1997, Hermione considered this book as she was sorting supplies for their mission to find Horcruxes. It was one of the books she decided to bring with them, stating that she ""wouldn't feel right"" if she didn't have it.

The book's original hand-written manuscript is stored in one of the Hogwarts Library's annexes, and can be only read by special appointment. However, students and staff may admire its ornate cover from a distance.",Bathilda Bagshot,,"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts,_A_History"
Snape: Scoundrel or Saint?,"Snape: Scoundrel or Saint? was a biography of Severus Snape written by Rita Skeeter. It was written sometime after Snape's death and given the speed with which Skeeter turned out one of her other sensational biographies, such as The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, may have been published as early as June 1998. Skeeter apparently penned the book despite public efforts by Harry Potter to bring to light Snape's key role in opposing Lord Voldemort. In keeping with her previous books it is likely to have been another hatchet job, and probably focused much more on depicting him as a scoundrel rather than as a saint.",Rita Skeeter,,http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Snape:_Scoundrel_or_Saint%3F
