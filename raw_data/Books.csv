The Tales of Beedle The Bard	The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a collection of stories written for young wizards and witches, published by Chelf Press. They were popular bedtime stories for centuries, with the result that The Wizard and the Hopping Pot and The Fountain of Fair Fortune were as familiar to many of the students at Hogwarts as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are to various Muggle children.

Magical Water Plants of the Mediterranean	In 1994, Barty Crouch Jr., disguised as Alastor Moody, gave a copy of this book to Neville Longbottom. As part of Crouch Jr.'s plan to manipulate the Triwizard Tournament to allow Harry Potter to win, he placed the book within Harry's reach as it contained information on Gillyweed, which would allow him to pass the Second Task. However, due to Harry's pride (not asking for help from everyone around him), he did not discover this book.

The Toadstool Tales	"The Toadstool Tales were a series of adaptations of other works, written by Beatrix Bloxam. They contained soppy, ""sanitized"" versions of other works, including the The Tales of Beedle the Bard , which was Mrs. Bloxam's way of purifying them so as to preserve childrens' innocence. Beatrix Bloxam set out to write The Toadstool Tales because of the ""unwholesome characters"" and themes found in The Tales of Beedle the Bard that she believed were damaging to children."

The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore	"Published in 1997 in the wake of Albus Dumbledore's death, this book brought the gritty secrets and rumors of Albus' past to public attention. The Daily Prophet rated The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore 5 stars and interviewed Rita Skeeter for a promotional article.

In this book, Skeeter covers how the Dumbledore family hid away Ariana Dumbledore's mental instability caused by a traumatatic assault. It goes on about how their father, Percival Dumbledore, was sent to Azkaban for seeking revenge against Ariana's attackers. It probes questions into Albus' friendship with Gellert Grindelwald who later becomes one of the world's powerful dark wizards, finally defeated by Albus in 1945. While still living in Godric's Hollow, Ariana was killed by getting in the way of a duel between her brothers and Grindelwald, and it is uncertain who dealt the killing blow. Rita also speculates that Harry Potter was involved with Albus' murder.

Fortunately for Rita Skeeter, the dead cannot be libelled"	Rita Skeeter	/static/images/life-and-lies.jpg	None	http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/The_Life_and_Lies_of_Albus_Dumbledore	"Albus Dumbledore

Hogwarts, A History	"Hogwarts: A History, also known as Hogwarts, A History, is a book concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and its history that was written by Bathilda Bagshot. It was Hermione Granger's favourite book and she often referred to this book on many things concerning Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Three of the things that are frequently brought up are the Great Hall's enchanted ceiling that shows the weather outside, the fact that you cannot apparate or disapparate on Hogwarts grounds and the fact that electronic devices do not work within the grounds.

The book was also very popular in Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts, when every copy was checked out of the library due to the reopening of the Chamber of Secrets. This caused Hermione great frustration, as despite her fondness for the book, she had left it behind that year due to lack of space because of the many texts assigned by Gilderoy Lockhart. However, Hermione shows slight frustration with the book when scathingly renaming the book in her fourth year because it does not mention the use of house-elves at Hogwarts, even going so far as to suggest a couple of alternative titles for it: A Revised History of Hogwarts and A Highly Biased and Selective History of Hogwarts Which Glosses Over the Nastier Aspects of the School.

In 1997, Hermione considered this book as she was sorting supplies for their mission to find Horcruxes. It was one of the books she decided to bring with them, stating that she ""wouldn't feel right"" if she didn't have it.

The book's original hand-written manuscript is stored in one of the Hogwarts Library's annexes, and can be only read by special appointment. However, students and staff may admire its ornate cover from a distance."	Bathilda Bagshot	None	None	http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts,_A_History	None	None	None
Snape: Scoundrel or Saint?	Snape: Scoundrel or Saint? was a biography of Severus Snape written by Rita Skeeter. It was written sometime after Snape's death and given the speed with which Skeeter turned out one of her other sensational biographies, such as The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, may have been published as early as June 1998. Skeeter apparently penned the book despite public efforts by Harry Potter to bring to light Snape's key role in opposing Lord Voldemort. In keeping with her previous books it is likely to have been another hatchet job, and probably focused much more on depicting him as a scoundrel rather than as a saint.
