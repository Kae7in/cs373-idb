Gryffindor	"Gryffindor is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, founded by Godric Gryffindor. The house prizes bravery, courage, nerve, chivalry, determination, and daring in their students. Its colors are red and gold, and its symbol is the lion. Its house ghost is Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, also known as ""Nearly-Headless Nick."" Gryffindor and Slytherin houses are fierce rivals.

The Gryffindor common room is located in one of the castle's towers, the entrance to which is guarded by an oil painting known as the Fat Lady. One must say the right password, which changes frequently, in order to enter."	house	Hogwarts	/static/images/gryffindor.jpg	Godric Gryffindor	The Triwizard Tournament	Nearly-Headless Nick	red and gold	lion	"You might belong in Gryffindor,
Where dwell the brave at heart,
Their daring, nerve and chivalry
Set Gryffindors apart."
Ravenclaw	"Ravenclaw is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, founded by Rowena Ravenclaw. The house prizes learning, wit, wisdom, creativity, individuality, tolerance, and intellect in its students. Its house colors are blue and bronze, and its symbol is the eagle. The house ghost is the Grey Lady, the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw.

The Ravenclaw common room is located in a high tower, which one may only enter after solving a logical riddle given by a bronze eagle-shaped knocker. This could be considered troublesome, since anyone with enough intellect could enter the tower, Ravenclaw or not, and this has happened before. However, most witches and wizards lack a sense of logic, which may be why Rowena chose to set up the security this way."	house	Hogwarts	/static/images/ravenclaw.jpg	Rowena Ravenclaw	None	The Grey Lady	blue and bronze	eagle	"Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
If you've a ready mind,
Where those of wit and learning,
Will always find their kind."
Slytherin	"Slytherin is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, founded by Salazar Slytherin. The house prizes cunning, resourcefulness, ambition, leadership, self-preservation, determination, cleverness, fraternity, and power in their students. Its colors are green and silver, and its symbol is the serpent. Its house ghost is the Bloody Baron. Slytherin and Gryffindor houses are fierce rivals. Most Slytherin students are pure-blood, due to the founder's mistrust of Muggle-born witches and wizards. Slytherin has a bad reputation as it is known that most dark wizards and witches are produced from Slytherin house. Most notably, Tom Marvolo Riddle, who later became Lord Voldemort, and most of his Death Eater followers were Slytherins.


The Slytherin common room is located in the dungeons underneath the Black Lake. To enter, one must say the correct password in front of a stone wall, which will then reveal a concealed stone door."	house	Hogwarts	/static/images/slytherin.jpg	Salazar Slytherin	Chamber of Secrets	The Bloody Baron	green and silver	serpent	"Or perhaps in Slytherin,
You'll make your real friends,
Those cunning folk use any means,
To achieve their ends."
Hufflepuff	"Hufflepuff is one of the four houses at Hogwarts, founded by Helga Hufflepuff. The house prizes dedication, hard work, fair play, patience, kindness, tolerance, honestly, and loyalty in their students. Its colors are yellow and black, and its symbol is the badger. Its house ghost is the Fat Friar. Hufflepuff appears to have the least rivalry with the other houses, possibly as they are less competitive or humble about their accomplishments due to their house traits. Due to Helga Hufflepuff's policy of accepting any student, Hufflepuff is often thought as the house with the less talented wizards, even though there have been exceptional witches and wizards from Hufflepuff. It is also notable that Hufflepuff has produced less dark wizards than any other house at Hogwarts.


The Hufflepuff common room has never been seen by outsiders and is the only house with repelling devices. Its entrance is located somewhere near the kitchens."	house	Hogwarts	/static/images/hufflepuff.jpg	Helga Hufflepuff	The Triwizard Tournament	The Fat Friar	yellow and black	badger	"You might belong in Hufflepuff,
Where they are just and loyal,
Those patient Hufflepuffs are true,
And unafraid of toil."
