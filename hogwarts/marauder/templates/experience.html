            <h3>For An Adventurous Outing: {{other.death_valley_buttes.name}}</h3>
            The {{other.death_valley_buttes.name}} are located in {{other.death_valley.name}}, a desert in {{other.death_valley.state}}.  There are {{other.death_valley.visitors}} visitors to {{other.death_valley.name}} per year, and most of them are dementors.
                Don't be surprised if during your strenuous hike you happen to catch a happy dementor family enjoying a barbecue or a picnic.
                Be sure to bring lots of water. You don't want to get dehydrated.
