            <h3>For A More Moderate Climb: {{other.rock_creek.name}}</h3>
                <p>If Hogsmeade is more your style than the Forbidden Forest, <strong>{{other.rock_creek.name}}</strong> will be a great spot for you and your friends. <strong>{{other.rock_creek.name}}</strong> is a hike of <strong>{{other.rock_creek.difficulty|lower}}</strong> difficulty, spanning <strong>{{other.rock_creek.distance}}</strong> miles and taking approximately <strong>{{other.rock_creek.time}}</strong> minutes by Muggle time (without apparating/cheating).</p>
                <p><strong>{{other.rock_creek.name}}</strong> is located in <strong>{{other.denali.name}} National Park</strong> in Alaska. After hiking the trail,
                cool off with a swim in the creek. If you look closely, hidden among the usual muggle-world fauna are a
                few scattered centaurs and woefully displaced house elves.</p>

            <h3>For A Relaxing Stroll: {{other.pinery.name}}</h3>
            <p>If your ideal Saturday afternoon is a stroll down Diagon Alley, hike the <strong>{{other.pinery.name}}</strong>, a <strong>{{other.rock_creek.difficulty|lower}}</strong> hike of <strong>{{other.rock_creek.distance}}</strong> miles, taking approximately <strong>{{other.rock_creek.time}}</strong> minutes.</p>
            <p>The <strong>{{other.pinery.name}}</strong> is located in the <strong>{{other.guadalupe_mountains.name}} National Park</strong> in Texas.  The {{other.pinery.name}} is very relaxing and non-strenuous. You will walk so little that by the time you reach the
            end of the trail you will feel like you just apparated there! And you won't come across anything more dangerous than a Flobberworm.
