            <h3>For An Adventurous Outing:<br />The {{other.death_valley_buttes.name}}</h3>
              <p>If you enjoy trips to the Forbidden Forest, the <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/hikes/Death%20Valley%20Buttes'>{{other.death_valley_buttes.name}}</a> hike is for you. It is a {{other.death_valley_buttes.distance}} mile {{other.death_valley_buttes.difficulty|lower}} hike, taking approximately {{other.death_valley_buttes.time}} minutes.</p>
                <p>The hike is located in <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/parks/Death%20Valley'>{{other.death_valley.name}}</a>, a desert in {{other.death_valley.state}}.
                There are {{other.death_valley.visitors}} visitors to {{other.death_valley.name}} per year, and most of them are dementors.
                Don't be surprised if during your hike you happen to catch a happy dementor family enjoying a barbecue or a picnic.
                Be sure to bring lots of water! You don't want to get dehydrated.</p>

            <h3>For A More Moderate Climb:<br />{{other.rock_creek.name}}</h3>
                <p>If Hogsmeade is more your style than the Forbidden Forest, <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/hikes/Rock%20Creek'>{{other.rock_creek.name}}</a> will be a great spot for you and your friends. {{other.rock_creek.name}} is a hike of {{other.rock_creek.difficulty|lower}} difficulty, spanning {{other.rock_creek.distance}} miles and taking approximately {{other.rock_creek.time}} minutes by Muggle time (without apparating/cheating).</p>

                few scattered centaurs and woefully displaced house elves.</p>

            <h3>For A Relaxing Stroll: {{other.pinery.name}}</h3>
            <p>If your ideal Saturday afternoon is a stroll down Diagon Alley, hike the <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/hikes/Pinery'>{{other.pinery.name}}</a>, a {{other.rock_creek.difficulty|lower}} hike of {{other.rock_creek.distance}} miles, taking approximately {{other.rock_creek.time}} minutes.</p>
            <p>The {{other.pinery.name}} is located in the <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/parks/Guadalupe%20Mountains'>{{other.guadalupe_mountains.name}} National Park</a> in Texas.  The {{other.pinery.name}} is very relaxing and non-strenuous. You will walk so little that by the time you reach the end of the trail you will feel like you just apparated there! And you won't come across anything more dangerous than a Flobberworm.</p>
