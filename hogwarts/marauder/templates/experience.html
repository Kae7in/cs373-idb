            <h3>For A More Moderate Climb: Rock Creek</h3>
                If Hogsmeade is more your style than the Forbidden Forest, Rock Creek will be a great spot for you and your friends.
                Rock Creek is a hike of moderate dificulty located in Denali National Park in Alaska. After hiking the trail,
                cool off with a swim in the creek. If you look closely, hidden among the usual muggle-world fauna are a
                few scattered centaurs and woefully displaced house elves.

            <h3>For A Relaxing Stroll: {{other.pinery.name}}</h3>
            If your ideal Saturday afternoon is a stroll down Diagon Alley, come to {{other.pinery.name}} Hike in the {{other.guadalupe_mountains.name}}!!
            Located in Texas, {{other.pinery.name}} Hike is relaxing and non-strenuous. You will walk so little that by the time you reach the
            end of the trail you will feel like you just apparated there! And you won't come across anything more dangerous than
            this rather large Flobberworm.
