                <p>If Hogsmeade is more your style than the Forbidden Forest, <a href='http://twistory.pythonanywhere.com/hikes/Rock%20Creek'>{{moderate_hike.name}}</a> will be a great spot for you and your friends. {{moderate_hike.name}} is a hike of {{moderate_hike.difficulty|lower}} difficulty, spanning {{moderate_hike.distance}} miles and taking approximately {{moderate_hike.time}} minutes by Muggle time (without apparating/cheating).</p>

                few scattered centaurs and woefully displaced house elves.</p>
