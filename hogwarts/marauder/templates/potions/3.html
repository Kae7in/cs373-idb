<p>Lord Voldemort used this potion to restore his body. Wormtail took <a href='characters/3'>Harry Potter's</a> blood by force to use in the potion, because Voldemort thought Harry's blood would enable him to obtain more power than he had ever possessed. However, Voldemort was not able to kill Harry because his mother's protection from her love was in his blood.</p>
