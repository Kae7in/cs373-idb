<p> Those who drink Veritaserum are forced to answer any question with whatever they believe is the truth.</p>
<p>There is an un-named antidote to Veritaserum. Also, Veritaserum's powers can be circumvented with Occlumency. Therefore, this potion cannot be considered a reliable indicator of innocence or guilt in a trial. The potion is also forbidden to be used against students at Hogwarts, much to Severus Snape's disappointment.</p>
