<p>Harry Potter is The Boy Who Lived<!-- <a href='/stories/3'>The Boy Who Lived</a> -->, one of the most famous wizards of his time. In July 1980, Voldemort tried to murder Harry Potter while he was still a baby, afraid of a prophecy that said Potter would be the one to defeat him. His mother Lily Potter sacrificed herself for Harry, which gave Harry an ancient form of protection magic based on love. This protection caused Voldemort's killing curse to backfire onto himself, but left Harry with a lightning-shaped cursed scar on his forehead. This created a connection between Harry and Voldemort, allowing Harry to speak Parseltongue.</p>

<p>Harry was raised by his aunt Petunia and uncle Vernon Dursley, who resented everything abnormal, including Harry. It wasn't until his 11th birthday that Potter discovered he was a wizard, and began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with the inheritance his parents left behind. Here he met his dearest friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Harry became one of the youngest seekers for the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his first year. He also became one of the youngest Triwizard Tournament contestants during his fourth year.</p>

<p>Along with other friends, Ron, Hermione, and Harry went on many adventures thrwarting evil throughout their school career. They stopped Professor Quirrell from bringing back Voldemort with the Philosopher's Stone. They stopped Tom Riddle's revival of the Chamber of Secrets. And finally in their last year at Hogwarts, they defeated Voldemort once and for all.</p>
